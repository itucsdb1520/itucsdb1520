**After clicking the "CRUD operations for Tracks", the new page will be shown to apply add, delete and update operations on Tracks table.**
For adding a new track, the name of the circuit must be unique and all fields must be filled. The location should be chosen from the location ID and the Grands Prix should be chosen from the Grands Prix ID.
Instead of selecting from the ID, two list box should be used to select the name of Grands Prix and Location.
For deleting a track from the database, it is enough to enter the name of the circuit.
Updating operation is similar to adding operation. The same issues about location and Grands Prix are present here.
If a circuit has a season value, the name of the circuit couldn't be changed because of the referential integrity.
In this kind of a situation, all columns can be changed except circuit name.
