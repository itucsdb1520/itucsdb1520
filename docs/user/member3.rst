   The single brand page with some information about the brand

There are 3 buttons for the brands page. Those buttons are for listing brands, founders and both of them, respectively. The corresponding pages opens when theose buttons are pressed.
List brands button lists all the brands along with edit and delete buttons. There is also an add button below which creates input fields by using javascript. Edit button also works similar. It uses
javascript for turning already filled information into input boxes filled with those information. Any change within those fields are applied if update button is pressed again. All fields are not required to be filled
except foundation year and country id.

Founders Page
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Founders table is also similar. The buttons are all the same. Adding is a bit different since it is required to enter a brand id. While adding a brand, you can simply enter the country name to add it. But this is not the case with the
founder. It has to be entered as the real brand id. This is not a feature rather it is a forgotten part that requires to be fixed. Each founder has a founder name and surname. The primary key is again an id variable since duplicate names and surnames may occur.
The brand id is placed as a foreign key so it is a necessary field to filled in. Name and surname can be NULL. This is allowed because there may be a founder with only a name or a surname (mononymous persons).
