There are 3 buttons for the brands page. Those buttons are for listing brands, founders and both of them, respectively. The corresponding pages opens when theose buttons are pressed.
List brands button lists all the brands along with edit and delete buttons. There is also an add button below which creates input fields by using javascript. Edit button also works similar. It uses
javascript for turning already filled information into input boxes filled with those information. Any change within those fields are applied if update button is pressed again. All fields are not required to be filled
except foundation year and country id.
